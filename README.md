# What is MethylMapper?

MethMap is designed for mapping short sequences (ie reads) to a reference bank. If requiered, when mapping methylated converted sequences, mismatches between a nucleotide ‘U’ from a query with a nucleotide ‘T’ from the bank are authorized. Otherwise, this script is a classical seed-and-extend heuristic.
